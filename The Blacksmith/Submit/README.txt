During this assignment I learned how to create a first person character controller, that was the first thing that I really struggled with. I used planes to create the environment the player walks around in, which worked out quite nicely. I first wanted to use a bunch of cubes to do this, but it was hard to navigate the scene view this way so I changed them.
